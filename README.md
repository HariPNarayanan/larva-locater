# larva-locater

## This project currently contains two scripts
# PrefIndex
This script takes a folder containing TRex tracked files as input and outputs the preference index calculated over 900 frames.

Preference index = (larvae in upper half - larvae in lower half)/total number of larvae

# Retention
This script takes a BlobMaster3000 tracked file and outputs the average distance from the centre of larvae after 10 minutes.
